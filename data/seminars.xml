        <title>From SLAM to Spatial AI</title>
        <abstract>To enable the next generation of smart robots and devices which can truly interact with their environments, Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) will progressively develop into a general real-time geometric and semantic `Spatial AI' perception capability. I will give many examples from our work on gradually increasing visual SLAM capability over the years. However, much research must still be done to achieve true Spatial AI performance. A key issue is how estimation and machine learning components can be used and trained together as we continue to search for the best long-term scene representations to enable intelligent interaction.  Further, to enable the performance and efficiency required by real products, computer vision algorithms must be developed together with the sensors and processors which form full systems, and I will cover research on vision algorithms for non-standard visual sensors and graph-based computing architectures.</abstract>
        <bio>Andrew Davison is Professor of Robot Vision and Director of the Dyson Robotics Laboratory at Imperial College London. His long-term research focus is on SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) and its evolution towards general `Spatial AI': computer vision algorithms which enable robots and other artificial devices to map, localise within and ultimately understand and interact with the 3D spaces around them. With his research group and collaborators he has consistently developed and demonstrated breakthrough systems, including MonoSLAM, KinectFusion, SLAM++ and CodeSLAM, and recent prizes include Best Paper at ECCV 2016 and Best Paper Honourable Mention at CVPR 2018. He has also had strong involvement in taking this technology into real applications, in particular through his work with Dyson on the design of the visual mapping system inside the Dyson 360 Eye robot vacuum cleaner and as co-founder of applied SLAM start-up SLAMcore. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2017.</bio>

        <title>Doing for our robots what nature did for us</title>
        <abstract>We, as robot engineers, have to think hard about our role in the design of robots and how it interacts with learning, both in "the factory" (that is, at engineering time) and in "the wild" (that is, when the robot is delivered to a customer). I will share some general thoughts about the strategies for robot design and then talk in detail about some work I have been involved in, both in the design of an overall architecture for an intelligent robot and in strategies for learning to integrate new skills into the repertoire of an already competent robot.</abstract>

        <title>Soft Robots for Humanity</title>
        <abstract>Traditional robotic manipulators are constructed from rigid links and localized joints – this enables large forces and workspaces, but restricts access and creates safety challenges. In contrast, many soft robots have a volumetric form factor and continuous bending that takes advantage of their flexible, deformable materials to access difficult spaces, but these same mechanical properties can hinder manipulation. This talk will examine robotic systems that achieve the best of both worlds by leveraging both softness and rigidity for novel shape control, a compliant interface to the human body, and accessing hard-to-reach locations. Knowing when to exploit and when to alter some of the inherent consequences of softness is key to making soft robots that can be deployed to benefit human health, safety, and quality of life.</abstract>

        <title>Optimizing Intended Reward Functions: Extracting all the right information from all the right places</title>
        <abstract>AI work tends to focus on how to optimize a specified reward function, but rewards that lead to the desired behavior consistently are not so easy to specify. Rather than optimizing specified reward, which is already hard, robots have the much harder job of optimizing intended reward. While the specified reward does not have as much information as we make our robots pretend, the good news is that humans constantly leak information about what the robot should optimize. In this talk, we will explore how to read the right amount of information from different types of human behavior -- and even the lack thereof. </abstract>

        <title>New Connections between Motion Planning and Machine Learning</title>
        <abstract>Any time a robot needs to move, a motion needs to be planned. But yet roboticists often treat motion planning as a black box, and barely understand fundamental algorithms like A*. In this talk, I’ll start with some intuition about search, via the absurd analogy of amoebas. I’ll use the analogy to describe the first-ever edge-optimal A*-like search algorithm we invented. I’ll then cast anytime search with experience (what we call the Experienced Piano Movers’ Problem) as an instance of Bayesian Reinforcement Learning, enabling us to derive the first-ever sublinear regret bounds for anytime motion planning. I’ll end with some open problems I want you all to solve, so I can retire in peace.</abstract>

        <abstract>While the NASA Mars 2020 rover may not be considered state of the art in robotics technology, the sampling system is at the forefront of the state of practice for robotic sampling in extreme environments. I will begin this talk with an overview of the Mars 2020 rover mission and mission objectives with a focus on the sampling and caching system. Through the course of the discussion I will highlight many of the challenges faced by operating in an extreme environment, complicated further by design constraints due to limitations on power, weight, and computational processing, and how we addressed those challenges.</abstract>

        <title>Form, Function, and Robotic Superorganisms</title>
        <abstract>Natural swarms exhibit sophisticated colony level behaviors with remarkably scalable and error tolerant properties. Their evolutionary success stems from more than just intelligent individuals, it hinges on their morphology, their physical interactions, and the way they shape and leverage their environment. Mound-building termites, for instance, are believed to use their own body as a template for construction; the resulting dirt mound serves, among many things, to regulate volatile pheromone cues which in turn guide further construction and colony growth. Throughout this talk I will argue how we can leverage the same principles to achieve greater performance in robot collectives, through hardware and software co-development, and by integrating the environment into the design process. I will give examples of systems from our lab that exploit form, function, and the concept of robotic superorganisms, spanning collective robotic construction inspired by African mound-building termites, ongoing work towards slime-mold inspired soft robot collectives, and initial studies of bio-hybrid collectives of honey bees.</abstract>
        <bio>Kirstin Petersen is an Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. Her lab, the Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab, is focused on design and coordination of large robot collectives able to achieve complex behaviors beyond the reach of an individual, and corresponding studies on how social insects do so in nature. Major research topics include swarm intelligence, embodied intelligence, and autonomous construction. Before arriving at Cornell, Petersen did a postdoc with the Physical Intelligence Department at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Germany. She completed a PhD in 2014 in computer science at Harvard University and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering.

        <title>Autonomous, Agile Micro Drones: Perception, Learning, and Control</title>
        <abstract>Autonomous quadrotors will soon play a major role in search-and-rescue, delivery, and inspection missions, where a fast response is crucial. However, their speed and maneuverability are still far from those of birds and human pilots. High speed is particularly important: since drone battery life is usually limited to 20-30 minutes, drones need to fly faster to cover longer distances. However, to do so, they need faster sensors and algorithms. Human pilots take years to learn the skills to navigate drones. What does it take to make drones navigate as good or even better than human pilots? Autonomous, agile navigation through unknown, GPS-denied environments poses several challenges for robotics research in terms of perception, planning, learning, and control. In this talk, I will show how the combination of both model-based and machine learning methods united with the power of new, low-latency sensors, such as event cameras, can allow drones to achieve unprecedented speed and robustness by relying solely on onboard computing.</abstract>
        <bio>Davide Scaramuzza (Italian) is a Professor of Robotics and Perception at both departments of Informatics (University of Zurich) and Neuroinformatics (joint between the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich), where he directs the Robotics and Perception Group. His research lies at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and machine learning, using standard cameras and event cameras, and aims to enable autonomous, agile navigation of micro drones in search and rescue applications. After a Ph.D. at ETH Zurich (with Roland Siegwart) and a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania (with Vijay Kumar and Kostas Daniilidis), from 2009 to 2012, he led the European project sFly, which introduced the PX4 autopilot and pioneered visual-SLAM-based autonomous navigation of micro drones in GPS-denied environments. From 2015 to 2018, he was part of the DARPA FLA program (Fast Lightweight Autonomy) to research autonomous, agile navigation of micro drones in GPS-denied environments. In 2018, his team won the IROS 2018 Autonomous Drone Race, and in 2019 it ranked second in the AlphaPilot Drone Racing world championship. For his research contributions to autonomous, vision-based, drone navigation and event cameras, he won prestigious awards, such as a European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator Grant, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Early Career Award, an SNSF-ERC Starting Grant, a Google Research Award, the KUKA Innovation Award, two Qualcomm Innovation Fellowships, the European Young Research Award, the Misha Mahowald Neuromorphic Engineering Award, and several paper awards. He co-authored the book "Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots" (published by MIT Press; 10,000 copies sold) and more than 100 papers on robotics and perception published in top-ranked journals (Science Robotics, TRO, T-PAMI, IJCV, IJRR) and conferences (RSS, ICRA, CVPR, ICCV, CORL, NeurIPS). He has served as a consultant for the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency's Fukushima Action Plan on Nuclear Safety and several drones and computer-vision companies, to which he has also transferred research results. In 2015, he cofounded Zurich-Eye, today Facebook Zurich, which developed the visual-inertial SLAM system running in Oculus Quest VR headsets. He was also the strategic advisor of Dacuda, today Magic Leap Zurich. In 2020, he cofounded SUIND, which develops camera-based safety solutions for commercial drones. Many aspects of his research have been prominently featured in wider media, such as The New York Times, BBC News, Discovery Channel, La Repubblica, Neue Zurcher Zeitung, and also in technology-focused media, such as IEEE Spectrum, MIT Technology Review, Tech Crunch, Wired, The Verge.</bio>
