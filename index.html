                <p>"Robotics Today - A series of technical talks" is a virtual robotics seminar series. The goal of the series is to bring the robotics community together during these challenging times. <b>The seminars are scheduled on Fridays at 3PM EDT (12PM PDT) and are open to the public</b>. The format of the seminar consists of a technical talk live captioned and streamed via <a href="watch.html" target="_blank">Web</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/RoboticsSeminar" target="_blank">Twitter (@RoboticsSeminar)</a>, followed by an interactive discussion between the speaker and a panel of faculty, postdocs, and students that will moderate audience questions.</p>

                <b>Abstract: </b> The health emergency caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has brought forward the need to carry out work safely even in environments that, previously familiar, have suddenly become potentially hostile. The need first arose in hospitals and retirement homes, but it also became evident in production, logistics, and trade. The need for safety and distancing can be given an incisive response by extending the paradigm of smart working to those jobs that require physical action on people and environments. Robotic technology will relieve people from exposure to risk and fatigue, while leveraging their skills to perform effectively. Collaborative robots and robotic avatars, semi-autonomous intelligent machines that can be sent to dangerous environments to perform highly dexterous tasks, will be able to transfer the irreplaceable skills of operators specialized in critical scenarios, avoiding dangers and physical fatigue. Advances in the field of robotics is enabling the development of machines with increased computational intelligence, exploiting their embodied “physical" intelligence. Informed by neuroscientific models of human behavior in interaction with the physical world, the new robots can safely touch humans and physically act in the environment. New sensing and display tools will bring other senses than just vision to share information on the world between a robot and a human. The fusion of such technologies, together with deeper understanding of how to interface humans and machines, is enabling a new relationship between humans and robots, that is much more of an integration than an interaction in the classical sense. I will consider examples of partial integration, as in prosthetics and rehabilitation, augmentation with exoskeletons and supernumerary limbs, and shared-autonomy robotic avatars, with the robot executing the human's intended actions and the human perceiving the context of his/her actions and their consequences. Finally, we will discuss how human-robot integration could be leveraged to program the machine through ``body language'' instructions which even robotics-naive users could intuitively give.<br/><br/>
